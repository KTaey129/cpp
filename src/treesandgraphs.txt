2-1 Binary Tree
1. Structure Definition:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node {
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
    int value;
};
struct: This defines a custom data structure called Node.
Member Variables:
Node* left: A pointer to another Node, representing the left child in a binary tree.
Node* right: A pointer to the right child of the node in the binary tree.
int value: Stores the value at this node (it could be any data, here it's an integer).
So, a Node has two links to other nodes (left and right) and an integer value (value).

2. Creating a Node (createNode function):
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* createNode(struct Node* left, struct Node* right, int value) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if (newNode == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    newNode->left = left;
    newNode->right = right;
    newNode->value = value;
    return newNode;
}
Function Purpose: This function creates a new Node and initializes its members (left, right, and value).

malloc:

malloc is a C function that allocates memory for a new Node. sizeof(struct Node) tells how much memory is needed for a Node structure.
The result of malloc is cast to (struct Node*) to turn the returned memory address into a pointer of type Node*.
if (newNode == NULL):

If memory allocation fails, malloc returns NULL. This condition checks if the memory allocation was successful. If not, it prints an error message and terminates the program using exit(1).
newNode->left = left:

Initializes the left pointer of the new node with the given left child.
newNode->right = right:

Initializes the right pointer of the new node with the given right child.
newNode->value = value:

Assigns the value passed to the function to the value member of the node.
Return Statement: Finally, it returns the pointer to the newly created Node.

3. Accessor Functions:
These functions provide access to the left child, right child, and value of a node. Each one returns part of the Node's structure:

Get Left Child:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* getLeft(struct Node* node) { return node->left; }
Takes a pointer to a Node as an argument.
Returns: The left child node (which is also a Node*).
Get Right Child:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* getRight(struct Node* node) { return node->right; }
Takes a pointer to a Node as an argument.
Returns

Continuing with the explanation:

Get Right Child:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* getRight(struct Node* node) { return node->right; }
This function takes a pointer to a Node as an argument.
Returns: The right child of the node (node->right), which is a pointer to another Node (or NULL if no right child exists).
Get Value:
cpp
코드 복사
int getValue(struct Node* node) { return node->value; }
This function takes a pointer to a Node as an argument.
Returns: The integer value stored in the node (node->value).
Key Concepts in This Code:
Structures (struct):

A struct groups together variables (often referred to as members or fields) under a single name, forming a composite data type. In this case, Node is a structure that represents an element in a binary tree.
Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc):

The function malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically at runtime. It is a C-style function to allocate memory on the heap, which persists until explicitly deallocated with free(). In C++, you'd typically use new and delete for dynamic memory management.
Pointers:

The tree structure is built using pointers. The left and right members of the Node are pointers to other Node objects (or NULL if there are no children). Pointers allow us to create dynamic and flexible structures like trees or linked lists.
Accessor Functions:

The getLeft, getRight, and getValue functions are accessor methods. They provide an easy way to access the individual fields of a Node without directly accessing the structure members outside the Node functions.
Encapsulation is a common practice in C++ to make sure the internal structure of objects (or nodes in this case) can be accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces, ensuring better control and flexibility.
Example Usage:
Let's imagine you're creating a simple binary tree:

cpp
코드 복사
int main() {
    // Create individual nodes
    struct Node* leftChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 2);   // Node with value 2 (no children)
    struct Node* rightChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 3);  // Node with value 3 (no children)
    
    // Create a parent node with the two children
    struct Node* root = createNode(leftChild, rightChild, 1);  // Root node with value 1

    // Access the left child of the root node
    struct Node* left = getLeft(root);  // left points to the node with value 2

    // Get the value of the root node
    int value = getValue(root);  // value is 1

    // Clean up memory (would normally use free for malloc'd memory in C)
    free(leftChild);
    free(rightChild);
    free(root);
    
    return 0;
}
In this example:

We create two child nodes (leftChild and rightChild) with values 2 and 3.
We then create a root node that has these two children and a value 1.
Using the accessor functions (getLeft and getValue), we retrieve information about the tree structure.
Summary:
This code defines a binary tree structure using pointers, dynamic memory allocation (malloc), and accessor functions.
The createNode function dynamically creates new nodes in the binary tree, initializing their left, right, and value members.
Accessor functions are provided to retrieve the left child, right child, and value of a node.
This code uses C-style memory management (malloc), but in C++ you would typically use new for allocation and delete for deallocation.

2-2 Binary Search Tree
1. Structure Definition:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node {
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
    int value;
};
struct Node: Defines a structure called Node that represents an element in a binary tree.
Member Variables:
Node* left: A pointer to the left child of the node (another Node).
Node* right: A pointer to the right child of the node.
int value: Stores an integer value at the node.
This Node structure allows us to build a binary tree, where each node can have two children (left and right).

2. findNode Function:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* findNode(struct Node* root, int value) {
    while (root != NULL) {
        int currval = root->value;
        if (currval == value) break;
        if (currval < value) {
            root = root->right;
        } else { // currval > value
            root = root->left;
        }
    }
    return root;
}
Function Purpose: This function searches for a node with a specific value in a binary search tree (BST).
Parameters:
struct Node* root: A pointer to the root of the binary tree, where the search starts.
int value: The value you are searching for in the tree.
Function Steps:
while (root != NULL):
This loop continues as long as root is not NULL, meaning we have nodes to search through.
We traverse the tree starting from the root until we find the node with the target value or reach a NULL pointer (end of the tree).
Inside the Loop:
Get the Current Node's Value:

cpp
코드 복사
int currval = root->value;
We retrieve the value stored at the current node and store it in currval.
Check if the Current Value Matches the Target:

cpp
코드 복사
if (currval == value) break;
If the current node's value (currval) matches the target value, the loop breaks, meaning we've found the node we're looking for.
Binary Search Logic:

cpp
코드 복사
if (currval < value) {
    root = root->right;
} else { 
    root = root->left;
}
If the current value is less than the target value, the target node (if it exists) must be in the right subtree (since values in the right subtree of a node are greater in a binary search tree).
If the current value is greater than the target value, the target node must be in the left subtree (since values in the left subtree are smaller).
This is the core of the binary search mechanism, which allows searching to happen in logarithmic time.

Return Statement:

cpp
코드 복사
return root;
After exiting the loop (either by finding the value or reaching a NULL pointer), the function returns the current root. If the value was found, it will point to the node containing the value; otherwise, it will be NULL (indicating the value was not found).
Key Concepts:
Binary Search Tree (BST):

In a binary search tree, for each node:
All values in the left subtree are smaller than the node’s value.
All values in the right subtree are larger.
This property makes searching efficient, as it eliminates half of the tree at each step.
Pointer Traversal:

The function updates the root pointer as it traverses the tree (either moving to the left or right child). It modifies the pointer to the next node based on the comparison of the current value with the target value.
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this function is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced binary search tree, h is proportional to log(n), where n is the number of nodes.
Example Usage:
cpp
코드 복사
int main() {
    // Create nodes manually (for example purposes)
    struct Node* leftChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 2);
    struct Node* rightChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 6);
    struct Node* root = createNode(leftChild, rightChild, 4); // root value is 4

    // Search for value 6
    struct Node* foundNode = findNode(root, 6);
    if (foundNode != NULL) {
        printf("Node with value %d found!\n", foundNode->value);
    } else {
        printf("Node not found!\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
In this example:

The binary search tree has a root node with value 4, a left child with value 2, and a right child with value 6.
The findNode function searches for the value 6. Since the value is found, it will print: Node with value 6 found!.
Summary:
This function efficiently searches for a value in a binary search tree by leveraging the properties of BSTs.
The logic relies on the comparison of values to decide whether to move left or right in the tree.
If the value is found, it returns the corresponding node; otherwise, it returns NULL

2-3 Binary Search Tree (2)
1. Structure Definition:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node {
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
    int value;
};
struct Node: This defines a structure called Node, which represents a node in a binary tree.
Member Variables:
Node* left: A pointer to the left child of the current node.
Node* right: A pointer to the right child of the current node.
int value: This stores the integer value held by the node.
This structure is the basic building block of the binary tree. Each Node can point to two child nodes (left and right) and store an integer value.

2. findNode Function:
cpp
코드 복사
struct Node* findNode(struct Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
    int currval = root->value;
    if (currval == value) return root;
    if (currval < value) return findNode(root->right, value);
    else return findNode(root->left, value);
}
Function Purpose: This function searches for a node with a given value in a binary search tree (BST).
Parameters:
struct Node* root: A pointer to the root of the binary tree (or subtree) where the search begins.
int value: The target value we are looking for in the tree.
Function Logic:
Base Case (Tree is Empty):

cpp
코드 복사
if (root == NULL) return NULL;
If the root is NULL, the function returns NULL. This means that either the tree is empty or we have reached the end of a branch without finding the value. Returning NULL indicates that the node with the given value does not exist in the tree.
Get the Current Node's Value:

cpp
코드 복사
int currval = root->value;
We retrieve the value of the current node and store it in the variable currval.
Check if the Current Node is the Target:

cpp
코드 복사
if (currval == value) return root;
If the value at the current node (currval) matches the target value, the function returns the current node (root). This means we've found the node with the desired value.
Binary Search Mechanism:

cpp
코드 복사
if (currval < value) return findNode(root->right, value);
else return findNode(root->left, value);
If the current value (currval) is less than the target value, we search the right subtree (root->right). In a binary search tree, values in the right subtree are always greater than the current node's value.

If the current value is greater than the target value, we search the left subtree (root->left), because the left subtree contains smaller values.

This uses recursion to keep calling findNode on the left or right child of the current node until it either finds the value or reaches a NULL node.

Recursive Nature:
Recursion: The function calls itself to search in the left or right subtrees. Each recursive call processes a smaller part of the tree, and the search proceeds down the tree until the value is found or a NULL node is encountered.
Example Usage:
cpp
코드 복사
int main() {
    // Manually creating a small binary search tree
    struct Node* leftChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 2);
    struct Node* rightChild = createNode(NULL, NULL, 6);
    struct Node* root = createNode(leftChild, rightChild, 4);

    // Search for value 6
    struct Node* foundNode = findNode(root, 6);
    if (foundNode != NULL) {
        printf("Node with value %d found!\n", foundNode->value);
    } else {
        printf("Node not found!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
Key Concepts:
Binary Search Tree (BST):

A binary search tree is a tree in which:
All values in the left subtree are smaller than the current node.
All values in the right subtree are larger.
This property allows efficient searching, where each comparison eliminates half of the tree.
Recursion:

The function uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller parts, searching the left or right subtree based on the current node's value.
In each recursive step, a smaller part of the tree is processed, eventually leading to the solution or returning NULL when the value isn't found.
Base Case:

The base case in recursion is essential to stop the function from making infinite recursive calls. In this function, the base case is when root == NULL, meaning we've reached a leaf or the tree is empty.
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the findNode function is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
In a balanced binary search tree, the height is approximately log(n), so the time complexity becomes O(log(n)).
In the worst case (a degenerate tree where all nodes are in a single line), the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
Summary:
This recursive function efficiently searches for a value in a binary search tree.
It utilizes the properties of BSTs to either move left or right based on the current node's value.
If the value is found, the corresponding node is returned; otherwise, it returns NULL.
